        <h1>Origins</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><em>"From the beginning Spartans were a weapon of last resort. We were built for combat and raised for war."</em> — Master Chief Petty Officer John-117</p>

            <h2>ORION Project</h2>
            <img src="images/OrionLogoSL.webp" alt="ORION Project" class="png-img">
            <p>The genesis of the SPARTAN programs occurred in 2321 with the activation of the ORION Project. Launched by the Office of Naval Intelligence, the project was named after the Greek hero Orion. The aim of the ORION Project was to create a special forces unit of biochemically augmented supersoldiers. Under the operational control of Naval Special Warfare Group One, the project was created to combat the growing Insurrection throughout the human Outer Colonies. The project enjoyed limited success but was ultimately disbanded after several years; however, its legacy lived on in the form of the subsequent SPARTAN programs. After the establishment of the SPARTAN-II program years later, the ORION Project was retroactively dubbed SPARTAN-I program.</p>
            <p>These candidates underwent rigorous testing and augmentations throughout the project's duration. However, the outcomes did not meet expectations, and the candidates were eventually integrated back into the regular military structure after the project was deemed ineffective and subsequently terminated. The lessons learned from ORION laid the groundwork for future programs aimed at developing enhanced soldiers for the UNSC.</p>

            <h2>The Spartan-IIs</h2>
            <p>Much about the SPARTAN-II program remains classified and cannot be disclosed. However, ONI has permitted us to share the following information: Led by the late Dr. Catherine Halsey, the SPARTAN-II program marked the first significant success in the SPARTAN initiative, aimed at creating elite soldiers through mechanical and biological augmentation. Originally conceived as the second generation of the ORION Project, it was referred to as "Generation-II ORION." The SPARTAN-II program was the first to combine advanced exoskeleton technology with the soldiers' enhanced physiques.</p>
            <p>SPARTAN-IIs underwent the most extensive and invasive physical augmentations of all the Spartan generations, beginning the process at the early military age of 18 to 20. This method increased their physical mass and height to approximately seven feet.</p>
            <p>Generation II of the ORION Project was initiated in 2526 when it became necessary to explore more effective methods for combating the Covenant.</p>

                <h2>MJOLNIR</h2>
                <p>The MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor System is a technologically advanced combat exoskeleton system designed to vastly improve the strength, speed, agility, reflexes, and durability of a Spartan supersoldier. The suit is named after the hammer of Thor in Norse mythology.</p>
                <p>The Mjolnir armor, developed alongside the SPARTAN-II program by ONI's Materials Group, is the most advanced tactical military hardware available. Designed by Dr. Catherine Halsey, Mjolnir aims to enhance the physical capabilities of SPARTAN soldiers through mechanical and biological augmentation. Each suit is incredibly costly, comparable to a small starship.</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>The majority of Spartan-IIs serve under Naval Special Warfare, a division of the UNSC Special Forces closely tied to Section Three of the Office of Naval Intelligence, which initiated the SPARTAN-II program. This structure remained intact even after the formation of the new Spartan Operations branch post-war.</p>
            <p>Spartan-IIs operate with considerable autonomy, typically in teams of three to five, although team size and composition vary based on mission requirements. Team leaders select Spartans suited to specific tasks, leading to established arrangements over time due to the dispersal of the original group during the Covenant War. Teams are designated by color for missions, with Blue, Red, and Green teams being the most prominent.</p>

                    <h2>The SPARTANS</h2>
                    <p>While many outsiders view them as single-minded, the Spartan-IIs remain independent thinkers. Dr. Halsey's intent was to mold the candidates into effective soldiers as some of her colleagues within ONI suggested. She believed that for the Spartans to be truly efficient, they must understand and embrace the significance of their mission. Consequently, the Spartans possess a profound understanding of their roles as protectors and the weight of their responsibilities. They embrace being Spartans as both a necessity and a calling.</p>
                    <img src="images/2615257187_b2214c4a5e.jpg" alt="Helping Hand">
                    <p>The training of the Spartan-IIs emphasized dedication to duty and the importance of winning at any cost, values they remain committed to. They often ignore concerns about their personal health as long as there is a mission to complete. As a result, they generally prefer planetary operations to being stationed aboard starships without the ability to contribute to an engagement.</p><img src="images/who-was-is-the-most-skilled-spartan-in-canon-lore-v0-cnguac41ay0c1.webp" alt="redteam" width="300">
                    <p>The Spartan-IIs share a strong sense of solidarity and camaraderie, often considering their fellow Spartans as family. This bond is reflected in their unique internal habits and signals, communicated through subtle gestures and body language that are largely indecipherable to outsiders. Only a select few, including Dr. Halsey and CPO Mendez, were privy to their best-kept secrets. Their familiarity with each other's body language allows them to function in perfect synergy during combat, with teamwork abilities described as almost telepathic.</p>

                <p>Within military circles, he is commonly referred to as "SPARTAN-117" or by the phonetic callsign "Sierra 117." Like all Spartans, John is viewed by the Covenant as a "Demon." However, he is particularly known as "the Demon," a title he earned following the destruction of a significant "alien structure."</p>
                <p>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, also known simply by his rank as the "Master Chief" or (as is common in military culture) simply as the "Chief," is a Spartan-II supersoldier of the UNSC Navy's Special Weapons division. He served as one of the most important figures of the Human-Covenant War. After over thirty years of active duty, he is one of the most decorated war veterans of the United Nations Space Command.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Service Record</h3>
                <p>By August of 2552, John had completed over two hundred military operations, including one hundred and thirty-six full campaigns; more than any other UNSC personnel on record at the time. He was one of only two Spartans designated as Hyper lethal. Though John has commanded nearly every Spartan-II at one time or another, most of his career has been spent as fireteam leader of Blue Team. His actions during the Human-Covenant War earned him every major UNSC service medal and combat award, save for the Prisoner of War Medallion. As the war neared its end, most of John's fellow SPARTAN-IIs were killed in action during the Fall of Reach. However, John and his AI companion Cortana fled Reach and their vessel fortuitously arrived at [Classified].</p>

                <p>The Covenant caught Reach completely off guard, launching a surprise attack that decimated defenses and shattered the planet's sense of security. The destruction of the Visigrad relay triggered the Winter Contingency, a plan designed to safeguard humanity in the event of an overwhelming threat. Unfortunately, the alert took weeks to reach the entire planet, leaving many unprepared for the impending invasion.</p>
                <p>In this desperate hour, the Spartans emerged as humanity's last line of defense. They fought valiantly against the overwhelming Covenant forces, exhibiting unparalleled bravery and skill in the face of insurmountable odds. Their efforts were heroic, and many Spartans made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives to protect Reach and its inhabitants, and though Reach did fall. It was their courage and determination that provided a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak situation, demonstrating the true spirit of the SPARTANs as the protectors of humanity.</p>
                <p>After the destruction of a supper carrier the largest Covenant fleet humanity has ever seen at the time arrived launching a massive assault, Chief and the Spartans were assigned to defend vital power generators essential for the planet's defense. In a race against time, John teamed up with Spartans Linda-058 and James-005, working tirelessly to prevent the Covenant from accessing crucial navigation data that could spell doom for humanity.</p>
                <p>Despite their best efforts, the Covenant overwhelmed Reach's defenses, resulting in devastating losses for the UNSC. During the chaos, James was tragically killed in action, and Linda suffered severe injuries, ultimately being placed in cryostasis in the hope of future revival.</p>

                <h2>Return to Earth</h2>
                <p>After the fall of Reach, the Master Chief and his AI companion, Cortana, manage to escape the devastation aboard the Pillar of Autumn. In a strategic move, they detonate the ship's engines, resulting in the destruction of the surrounding Covenant fleet. Adrift for a week, they eventually encounter other survivors, including Sergeant Johnson and Corporal Locklear. Together, they seize control of the Covenant flagship, Ascendant Justice, to return to the Reach system.
                Upon their arrival, they discover remaining Spartans and Vice Admiral Whitcomb. United in purpose, they formulate a plan to thwart the Covenant's impending invasion of Earth. The Chief and his team undertake a daring rescue of trapped Spartans, preparing for the looming threat. However, the Covenant soon discover their location, leading to a fierce battle. In a desperate bid for survival, the UNSC allies with hidden human separatists, but they are ultimately forced to flee.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <p>Determined to disrupt the Covenant invasion fleet, the Spartans infiltrate a Covenant space station, setting it to self-destruct before making their escape. The surviving Spartans, along with Sergeant Johnson and Cortana, take the partially repaired UNSC Gettysburg back to Earth to warn of the approaching Covenant forces.</p>
               <p>After the final battle of the war, John was believed to be dead, lost on the other side of a collapsing slipspace portal. For several months, he and Cortana were presumed lost despite extensive search efforts led by Admiral Margaret Parangosky, the Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence. The forward section of the Forward Unto Dawn, carrying the Arbiter, crash-landed on Earth.

                On March 3, 2553, Lord Hood commissioned a memorial near Mount Kilimanjaro in Voi, Africa to honor UNSC service members who lost their lives during the war. The ceremony was attended by John's closest allies SCPO Franklin Mendez, and fellow Spartans Frederic-104, Kelly-087, and Linda-058, along with Naomi-010. Thel 'Vadam was also present at the memorial dedication, where Lord Hood expressed gratitude for his support alongside John "to the end." Despite the solemn occasion, Thel voiced skepticism about John's death, knowing firsthand the resilience of the Spartan.
                John's Spartan tag was inscribed on the memorial by an unknown individual, accompanied by the rank meaning that he recived a postumes promotion Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
                
                Unknown to everyone else, John and Cortana survived the explosion in the remaining cargo section of the Forward Unto Dawn. However, the ship was nearly powerless and could not be properly navigated. Cortana, relieved to find John alive, John instructed her to wake him when she needed him. In July 2557 the Master Chief was found by the UNSC Infinity. bringing him home after 4 years.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">SPARTAN-IVs</h2>
            <p>Today, although few Spartan-IIs remain in the galaxy following the war, humanity is not without protection. Enter the SPARTAN-IVs, consisting of combat veterans such as ODSTs our new generation of defenders. The SPARTAN-IV program was initiated in early 2553, conceived by Lieutenant Commander Musa-096, a former Spartan-II candidate whose own augmentation process left him crippled. Despite his resentment toward Dr. Catherine Halsey, Musa recognized the vital role that Spartans play in safeguarding humanity and understood the continued necessity of supersoldiers in the aftermath of the Human-Covenant War.</p> <img src="images/3883419-hd_haloinfinite_conceptart_002.jpg" alt="join">

                <p>With Admiral Margaret Parangosky, then-Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence, approving the proposal, the SPARTAN-IV program was officially launched. The first class, consisting of 145 members, became active on January 7, 2553. Due to the initial success, Commander Musa secured additional funding for a second class, which began in 2554 and was notably larger, drawing from a broader pool of candidates.
                
                The SPARTAN-IV program is based at a dedicated facility on Mars, where augmentation procedures take place. This compound is equipped to enhance a dozen Spartans at a time. Training occurs primarily in a top-secret location.
                
                Hundreds of Spartan-IVs are assigned to the UNSC Infinity, the most formidable warship ever built by humanity. The frigate UNSC Meriwether Lewis also hosts its own Spartan contingent. On Infinity, Spartan-IVs engage in training simulations known as "War Games" on a state-of-the-art combat deck, designed to replicate various environments and ensure they remain battle-ready. Beyond the simulations, they train in multiple forms of martial arts. As per STO 11.6, their daily regimen includes at least two hours of military specialty training and two hours of physical conditioning and augmentation monitoring.
                The Spartan-IVs operate within a dedicated branch of the UNSC called Spartan Operations, in contrast to their predecessors who were integrated into different chains of command. Some Spartan-IVs take on covert roles within ONI. The majority of the Spartan-IVs are adult volunteers, but surviving Spartans from the Human-Covenant War were also offered integration into this new branch. </p>
