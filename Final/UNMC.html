            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p><em>"First to Fight."</em> — UNSC Marine Corps Credo</p>
            <p>
                The UNSC Marine Corps stands as one of the most formidable and resilient branches of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), with a proud tradition of being the first into battle. This elite force is responsible for executing land-based expeditionary, amphibious, and airborne combat operations, often on the front lines of humanity's defense. Utilizing the swift mobility of the UNSC Navy, Marines are deployed rapidly across galaxies, ready to engage and neutralize threats wherever they arise.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Interplanetary_War-2.webp" alt="Interplanetary War" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 300px;">
            <p style="text-align: right;">(photo captured from the Helmet-cam of PVT. J.Rossbach of the 405th Marine Infantry Division K.I.A. during an ambush during the battle)</p>
            <p>
                In addition to their combat roles, UNSC Marines are entrusted with the critical task of defending Navy vessels and installations from hostile forces, ensuring the safety of vital infrastructure and personnel. Although structured under the Unified Ground Command, the Marine Corps operates in close coordination with the UNSC Naval Command, often assuming joint authority in strategic operations. As one of the five esteemed uniformed services of the UNSC Armed Forces, the Marine Corps continues to lead the charge, upholding humanity's last line of defense across the stars.
            </p>

            <h3>Origins and Formation</h3>
            <p>
                The United States Marine Corps paved the way for the formidable UNSC Marine Corps. As the fires of the Interplanetary War ignited in the 2160s, governments across the Sol system ramped up their military might. Yet, disorganization plagued their scattered forces, causing chaos among the ranks. In response, the United Nations stepped in and, in 2163, formed a new and elite fighting force: the United Nations Space Command, complete with its powerful Navy and its indomitable Marine Corps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born from the fusion of naval and spaceborne expeditionary units from across the globe, the UNSC Marine Corps stood as a united, unstoppable force. Their first great test came in December 2163, when the enemy struck at the heart of humanity's shipbuilding efforts on Mars. The UNSC Marines, forged in fire and steel, launched a series of lightning-fast assaults, overwhelming the enemy forces near Argyre Planitia. It was humanity’s first extraterrestrial military engagement, and the Marines emerged victorious.
            </p>
            <p>
                This resounding victory solidified the UNSC Marine Corps as the galaxy’s premier fighting force. From then on, UNSC Navy warships would carry battalions of these battle-hardened warriors, ready to strike fear into the heart of any enemy. Recruitment surged, and propaganda rallied entire generations to join their ranks. By 2170, the UNSC had crushed the forces threatening Earth, and the Marines were celebrated as humanity’s saviors. They remain the sword and shield of the UNSC, prepared to defend all of mankind against any threat, no matter how distant or how dire.
            </p>

            <h3>The Insurrection</h3>
            <p>
                From 2494 to 2525, the UNSC Marine Corps was the first line of defense against Insurrectionist uprisings across UNSC colonies and star systems. By 2512, the Marines found themselves engaged in one of the largest and most significant operations in their storied history—Operation: TREBUCHET. This daring campaign aimed to crush rebel forces in the volatile Eridanus and Epsilon Eridani star systems, where insurgent activities had reached a fever pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fearless 9th Marine Expeditionary Force was dispatched to Eridanus II, with orders to capture rebel leaders and restore order. One of these elite units, the 1st Battalion of the 21st Marine Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ponder, embarked on a high-stakes mission in Elysium City. Their goal: to capture the second-in-command of the rebel forces. But the operation took a tragic turn, ending in a devastating loss—rebel leader's family members were killed, and Ponder himself was wounded and subsequently demoted.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 2524, the rebellion had spread to the colony world of Tribute. There, a determined Marine battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Aboim and backed by the UNSC corvette <em>Bum Rush</em>, along with AV-14 Hornet air support, took on the daunting task of halting rebel bomb makers operating near the city of Casbah. In a fateful operation, two special warfare squads—under the command of the legendary Staff Sergeants Avery Johnson and Nolan Byrne—found themselves in the midst of a catastrophic event. During a tense hostage situation at a local restaurant, Byrne's team suffered heavy losses. The operation ended in disaster, with thirty-eight civilians, three Marines, and two rebels losing their lives in the ensuing bombing. The grim toll only fueled the Marines' resolve to fight harder and protect humanity from the insurrectionist threat.

            <h3>Human-Covenant War</h3>
            <img src="images/892330-best-halo-reach-wallpaper-1920x1080-image.jpg" alt="Covenant War" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 300px;"><p style="text-align: right;">(image captured from the helmet-cam of SGT. D.Arazi during the evacuation of Planet Coral)</p>
            <p>
                The UNSC Marine Corps first encountered the alien Covenant at the horrific First Battle of Harvest in 2525. With only three Marine officers present, training the Colonial Militia, the Marines faced a fierce and relentless enemy. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Marines fought valiantly, with Captain Ponder becoming the Corps' first hero to fall in defense of humanity. His sacrifice marked the beginning of the Marine Corps' legendary stand against the alien threat.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Harvest, the Marines proved time and again that they were humanity's shield. During the grueling Harvest Campaign from 2526 to 2531, the Marines established an arctic base on the planet, setting the stage for one of their most remarkable victories. Led by the fearless Sergeant John Forge, the Marines encountered a devastating Covenant assault under the ruthless Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee. Despite overwhelming odds, Forge rallied his scattered troops, retook the base, and held off the Covenant long enough for reinforcements to arrive. This victory wasn't just a battle won, but a message to the Covenant: humanity, and its Marines, would not fall easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final weeks of 2525, the UNSC Marine Corps deployed en masse to Alpha Corvi II, tasked with defending its capital city from a Covenant onslaught. The Covenant came with superior firepower, but the Marines fought with unmatched tenacity. Their efforts were critical in diverting Covenant forces, allowing Blue Team to secure a crucial artifact. Though the battle came at a great cost, with over thirty percent casualties, the Marines proved once again that they would sacrifice everything to defend the future of humanity. Their bravery forced the Covenant to fight for every inch of ground, no matter the cost.

            <h2>Operating Forces</h2>
            <h3>Personnel</h3>
            <p>
                Large numbers of men and women are employed by the UNSC Marine Corps. Service people hold ranks, which are divided between officers and enlisted. The rank structure of the UNSC Marine Corps is based around that of the United States Marine Corps.
            </p>

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>
                UNICOM's structure is loosely modeled after the former United States Marine Corps, with notable differences due to technological advancements and humanity's spread across the stars. The use of artificial intelligence and automated systems allows for much of UNICOM's administrative functions to be handled efficiently.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fireteam</strong> - 4 personnel led by a Lance Corporal or Corporal.</li>
                <li><strong>Section</strong> - Around 8 personnel led by a Lance Corporal or Corporal.</li>
                <li><strong>Squad</strong> - Around 12 to 13 personnel led by a Lance Corporal, Corporal, or Sergeant.</li>
                <li><strong>Platoon</strong> - Around 40 personnel led by a Second Lieutenant and a Staff Sergeant.</li>
                <li><strong>Company</strong> - Around 180 personnel consisting of four platoons plus a Company Headquarters Section.</li>
                <li><strong>Regiment</strong> - 3,000 personnel commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, or Brigadier General.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Forces</h3>
            <p>
                UNICOM oversees deployments of the UNSC Air Force and UNSC Army, as well as select units of the UNSC Marine Corps. Marine units typically organized under UNICOM are responsible for long-term planetary security, training, and augmenting other UNSC garrisons.

            <h2>Aircraft</h2>
            <p>For the most part, UNSC aircraft use jet thrusters mounted on pivots to provide vertical thrust. The dominant advantage of this is that it is capable of being used for conventional thrust as well, including horizontal and lateral thrust, by tilting the jet engines. Aircraft such as the D77-TC Pelican, the AC-220 Vulture gunship, and the AV-14 Hornet use this type of VTOL configuration. In addition, the UH-144 Falcon, in service with the UNSC Army, is also a VTOL craft.</p> <h2>Vertical Take-off and Landing</h2>
            <p>abbreviated to VTOL, is a classification of aircraft meaning that take-off and landing, rather than needing a runway down which a craft travels to build up speed and lift, is conducted vertically by thrusters or propellers. The key advantage of VTOL capability is that it enables an aircraft to hover over an area, allowing for longer loiter time, and allow the craft to operate from a diverse array of airfields, using less space to get airborne. VTOL capability uses more fuel than Conventional-Takeoff-and-Landing (CTOL) capability, though</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pelican variants</strong>The Pelican line entered service in 2392.The air frame of the Pelican allows them to carry heavy objects underneath their tail booms. Common carry items include an M12 Warthog, M808 Scorpion tank, troop deployment pods or resupply canisters.

                    Pelicans receive serial numbers to be identified by during radio transmissions, particularly in combat situations. Each serial number consists of a letter from the Phonetic Alphabet followed by a number. Though a few Pelicans have this number inscribed on their cargo bays, most have no distinguishing mark on their exteriors. </li>
                <li><strong>AV-14 Hornet</strong>is a VTOL capable aircraft in service since at least 2524, during the Insurrection.It served all the way into the Human-Covenant War from the Battle for Arcadia to the Battle for Earth</li>
                <li><strong> UH-144 Falcon</strong>Created by Misriah Armory and introduced in 2497, the Falcon first saw use during the Insurrection. Numerous variants have been produced since, with service continuing all the way to 2552. The Falcon would continue to see service with the UNSC up to at least 2557.</li>
                <li><strong>AC-220 Gunship</strong>colloquially known as the Vulture, is a heavy gunship manufactured by Ushuaia Armory and fielded by the United Nations Space Command.
