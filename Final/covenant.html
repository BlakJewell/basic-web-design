        <h2>The Enemy</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Your destruction is the will of the gods, and we are their instrument."</em> — Believed to be the words of Truth at the start of the war.</p>
        <p>The Covenant, often referred to as the Covenant Empire or Covenant Hegemony, was a vast religious alliance that controlled a significant portion of the Orion Arm in our galaxy for thousands of years. Initially, it was a coalition between the San'Shyuum (Prophets) and the Sangheili (Elites), but over time, it expanded to include six other species: the Huragok, Mgalekgolo (Hunters), Unggoy (Grunts), Kig-Yar (Jackals), Yanme'e (Drones), and Jiralhanae (Brutes). These diverse species united in their worship of the mythological "Forerunners".</p>
        <p>By 2525, the Covenant was ruled by the High Prophets of Truth, Mercy, and Regret. During this period, they initiated a genocidal campaign against humanity that lasted nearly 30 Earth standard years, until their eventual defeat in December 2552. Despite being one of the most powerful military forces in the galaxy, the Covenant faced formidable challenges. Internal conflicts, coupled with our relentless resistance, ultimately shattered the unity of the empire. This led to a significant division, particularly resulting in the expulsion of the Sangheili (Elites).</p>
        <p>After the Covenant's collapse at the Battle of the Citadel, some loyalists managed to survive and reemerged years later. Various factions also formed from the remnants of the former empire. Some separatists aimed to recreate the Covenant under Sangheili leadership, free from San'Shyuum influence. One of the more notable factions, led by Jul 'Mdama, claimed to be a new "Covenant," maintaining several of the old empire’s religious tenets. Additionally, several hostile factions emerged, utilizing assets from the fallen empire, including Merg Vol's faction, Sali 'Nyon's faction, Vata 'Gajat's faction, and the Banished.</p>

                <p>The Kig-Yar, also known as Jackals, were the first aliens encountered by humanity near Harvest. This initial contact set off a chain of events that would lead to full-scale military action between humanity and the Covenant. The Kig-Yar continued to patrol the space surrounding humanity's known territories. They were instrumental in discovering numerous human colonies, including Madrigal, and reported their findings to the rest of the Covenant fleet.</p>
                <p>In combat, they typically serve as snipers and scouts due to their exceptional senses of sight, smell, and hearing.</p>

                <p>Jackals share many features with Earth avians and reptiles. They exhibit characteristics common among species that evolved in low-gravity environments. Their legs are sinewy and muscular, structured in a digitigrade manner. They possess very sharp teeth and a hooked, bird-like beak. Both their hands and feet are tridactyl, with sharp talons, and their hands have a unique structure with a large middle finger surrounded by two opposable thumbs.</p>

                <summary>Advice to Civilians</summary>
                <p>If encountered, it is best to retreat. Given their speed, it is unlikely you can get away without a vehicle. If they confront you in close quarters, a blunt weapon can be effective as Jackals are somewhat physically frail with bones similar to birds.</p>
                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not hide from Jackals, as their sense of smell is acute. If hiding is necessary, barricade all entrances and wait for UNSC forces while masking your scent. They are opportunistic and will move on if prey is too difficult to get to.</p>
