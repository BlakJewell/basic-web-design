        <h2>SN:01928-19912-JK Captain Jacob Keys</h2>
        <p>Jacob Keyes was a commanding officer and one of the most brilliant tacticians in the UNSC Navy, commanding great respect as a strategist and inspirational leader. With thirty-five years of combat experience against both the Covenant and Insurrectionists, he was an almost natural choice to command the UNSC Pillar of Autumn and its secret cargo. Renowned as a war hero, Keyes developed the Keyes Loop tactic, showcasing his exceptional skill and foresight.

            Born on Earth, Keyes had a childhood marked by time spent around the Pacific Ocean. He had a sister who later resided on the colony world of Dwarka. During his training in Officer Candidate School, he endured a traumatic incident that resulted in the death of fourteen ensigns due to an instructor's error. Keyes suffered plasma burns during this test and chose to protect his instructor rather than testify against him, earning him the attention of Dr. Catherine Halsey.
            
            In 2517, shortly after entering service, Keyes was chosen to assist Dr. Halsey with her SPARTAN-II project, tasked with finding suitable subjects for the program. His ability to keep a secret made him a valuable asset to Halsey, and he never forgot the names of the children he observed during this pivotal assignment.
            
            Keyes's journey continued as he became a widely known hero during the early Human-Covenant War, leading security troops against a Covenant ambush and sustaining injuries that temporarily sidelined him. Despite being labeled "Schoolmaster" by detractors, he later took in his daughter, Miranda, fostering a close relationship that would shape her future in the military.
            
            His military career flourished as he took command of the UNSC Iroquois and later the Pillar of Autumn. Keyes displayed remarkable tactical ingenuity, notably during the Battle of Sigma Octanus IV, where he executed the "Keyes Loop" maneuver, destroying multiple Covenant vessels. This victory earned him a promotion to Captain and recognition within the UNSC.
            
            As the Covenant's relentless assault on Reach unfolded, Keyes was given a critical mission: to transport SPARTAN-II commandos deep into Covenant space to capture a High Prophet. However, when the Covenant attacked, he adjusted his plans, offloading most of the Spartans to aid in the defense of the planet.
            
            Tragically, Keyes's fate took a dire turn. After bravely attempting to hold off the Covenant forces, he was ultimately forced to retreat aboard the Pillar of Autumn, which was relentlessly pursued and ultimately destroyed by the Covenant. Many believe he went down with the ship, a heroic end befitting a legendary figure. Yet, if you seek the truth behind his final moments, perhaps the Master Chief himself could recount the tale—if you have the courage to ask.</p>

        <h2>SN:15972-19891-MK Commender Maranda Keys</h2>
        <p>Commander Miranda Keyes, born Miranda Halsey. as the daughter of the late Captain Jacob Keyes and the late Doctor Catherine E. Halsey. during her time in the military she quickly ascended through the ranks and served as the commanding officer of both the UNSC In Amber Clad as well as the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn during the final months of the Human-Covenant War. She was also the commander of the human expedition force to an alien structure known as the Ark in late 2552, leading humanity in the final battle of the war.Like her father, Miranda Keyes was known for unorthodox tactics, one of the bravest officers in the Navy. This was demonstrated by her decision to follow the covenant higher arc Regret's flagship. into slipspace during the Battle of Mombasa, when she crashed the UNSC Hilbert into the Covenant destroyer over Gamma Pavonis VII, and leading the final battle of the war, when she crashed her Pelican through the a window in a last-ditch effort to rescue Avery Johnson moments before her death.
            Due to her unexpected move to follow Regret's ship into slipspace, she was described by Commander Richard Lash as "the ballsiest officer in the Fleet". He further suggested that she may have been trying to live up to the reputation of her father or that she was simply "nuts".(still has more ribbins on her coller than you Dick)
            Although she and her father were not particularly close, Miranda identified with him more than she did with her mother. This is suggested by her decision to take up her father's surname after being raised by her mother. As a child, Miranda was often curious and excited about her father's assignments. While her father was serving in the Outer Colonies, Miranda would often learn about naval tactics by herself for her own enjoyment. Even at a young age, she did not require much affection from Jacob, though she did enjoy walking down Armstrong Alley with him to admire the scenery. the navy lost one of its best in that battle.</p>

        <h2>SN:03956-26127-PC Admiral Preston j. Cole</h2>
        <p>Preston J. Cole is best known for commanding the majority of the UNSC Navy and for his pivotal role in creating the Cole Protocol—a crucial law designed to protect Earth’s location from the Covenant. A military genius, he defeated the Covenant in every major battle he fought, earning accolades that placed his battle record on par with, or even superior to, that of the Spartan-IIs. Tragically, in 2543 during the Battle of Psi Serpentis, Cole was reported killed when a gas giant was detonated, annihilating a Covenant fleet. However, speculation persists among some officers that he may have survived, choosing to retire away from the UNSC to evade the burdens of command.

            Born on November 3, 2470, in Mark Twain, Missouri, Cole grew up in a large family and faced financial struggles. Despite his humble beginnings, he displayed remarkable intelligence from a young age. At just fourteen, he penned a report on colonial expansion that foreshadowed the Insurrection. Cole enlisted in the UNSC Navy after high school, viewing it as his only opportunity for exploration and adventure among the stars.
            
            Cole's early naval career was marked by a series of significant engagements, most notably during the Callisto Incident, where he showcased his tactical acumen. His quick thinking and bold maneuvers earned him rapid promotions, leading to command of a destroyer and later the heavy destroyer UNSC Gorgon. His reputation as a hero grew during the Insurrection, although it came at a personal cost—his marriage to Inna Volkov ended in divorce.
            
            As the Covenant threat escalated, Cole re-emerged as a formidable leader. He was appointed to command the UNSC's largest assembled fleet at the time, Battle Group X-Ray, and played a crucial role in the successful counteroffensive against the Covenant at Harvest.</p>
            
            <h2>The Cole Protocol</h2>
           <p> In response to the Covenant's relentless advances, Cole authored the Cole Protocol, which mandated that no UNSC vessel should provide information regarding human locations to the enemy. This protocol became a cornerstone of UNSC strategy, emphasizing the need for secrecy to protect humanity’s future.
            
            The Battle of Psi Serpentis and Speculation on Survival
            During the climactic Battle of Psi Serpentis, Cole's strategic genius was on full display as he led a fleet of 162 warships against overwhelming Covenant forces. Despite the odds, he executed a bold maneuver that resulted in the destruction of numerous enemy vessels. However, in the ensuing chaos, Cole’s flagship, the UNSC Everest, was lost in a spectacular explosion that destroyed the gas giant Viperidae and the remaining Covenant fleet.
            
            Following his presumed death, a day of mourning was declared for Cole, hailed as one of humanity's greatest heroes. Yet, speculation surrounding his fate has persisted. Analysis of battle footage led to the belief that Cole might have survived the explosion through a calculated escape using a decoy and slipspace jump. Some theorize that he sought a peaceful life, perhaps reuniting with a former love, Lyrenne Castilla, away from the chaos of war.
            
            Vice Admiral Preston J. Cole remains a complex figure in UNSC history—celebrated for his tactical brilliance, his dedication to humanity, and the enduring mystery of his fate. Whether he truly perished at Psi Serpentis or crafted an elaborate escape, Cole's legacy as a military tactician and symbol of hope endures, continuing to inspire those who serve in defense of humanity.

        <p><strong>"When I joined the Corps, we didn't have any fancy-shmancy tanks. We had sticks! Two sticks, and a rock for the whole platoon - and we had to share the rock!
            — Sergeant Johnson</strong></p>
            <p>Sergeant Major Avery Johnson was a renowned senior non-commissioned officer in the UNSC Marine Corps, whose military career spanned crucial conflicts against both the Insurrection and the Covenant. Born on November 23, 2474, in the Greater Chicago Industrial Zone on Earth, Johnson faced a turbulent childhood. After his parents' tumultuous marriage ended, he was raised by his aunt, Marcille, who instilled in him strong values and a deep sense of justice. This upbringing played a significant role in shaping his motivations to join the military, driven by a desire to protect innocents from the threats posed by Insurrectionists.

            Avery enlisted in the UNSC Marine Corps at the age of nineteen, quickly distinguishing himself through exceptional training and dedication. His skills earned him a place in the highly classified ORION Project, where he underwent bioengineering protocols designed to create super-soldiers. Despite the project's eventual shutdown, Johnson's talents were leveraged in numerous high-stakes operations against Insurrectionists, demonstrating his capability in both sniping and close-quarters combat.
            
            During the Human-Covenant War, Johnson became a pivotal figure. He actively resisted the Covenant's initial attack on Harvest and participated in key battles throughout the conflict, including the Fall of Reach and engagements on various installations, His strategic acumen and charismatic leadership were vital in forming an alliance with The Elite Fleet of Retribution after the Great Schism in November 2552.

        <h2>SN 42987-66589-JA Colonel James Ackerson</h2>
        <p>James Ackerson was a complex figure within the ranks of the UNSC, known for his strategic maneuvers and contentious relationship with Dr. Catherine Halsey. From a young age, he shared a passion for fantasy literature with his brother Ruwan, which inspired their imaginative quests, particularly for the mythical Key of Osanalan. This childhood fascination would later influence his thinking and decisions as an adult.

            During his military career, Ackerson trained on Cyrus VII and quickly established himself as a prominent figure within the Office of Naval Intelligence. His political acumen allowed him to secure a position on the UNSC Security Council and influence various high-profile projects, including the development of advanced military technology like the HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL exoskeleton series. His rivalry with Dr. Halsey stemmed from their competing interests and visions for the future of the UNSC's super-soldier programs.
            
            Ackerson's ambitions reached a peak when he attempted to undermine the SPARTAN-IIs, with his willingness to go to extreme lengths to assert his dominance and control over military programs. However, his machinations ultimately backfired, and he faced repercussions for his actions.
            
            As the Covenant threat escalated, Ackerson's path led him to Mars, where he continued to serve as a combat officer. During the Battle of Mare Erythraeum, he was captured by the Covenant, and in a desperate act to protect his brother and stall the Covenant's advance on Earth, he fabricated a story about the Key of Osanalan. This ploy bought Ruwan time to plan a counterstrike against the Covenant.
            
            Tragically, Ackerson's life ended in betrayal, and he was executed by the Jiralhanae after revealing the truth behind his deception. His death marked a pivotal moment, as it not only underscored the risks faced by those involved in the war but also served as a testament to the lengths individuals would go to protect their loved ones. Despite his controversial legacy, Ackerson's name was ultimately honored on the Voi Memorial, a bittersweet recognition of his complex character and the sacrifices made during the tumultuous era of the Human-Covenant War.

           <p>As a member of the 23rd Naval Air Squadron, Foe Hammer was recognized for her exceptional flying abilities and unyielding courage. When the UNSC Pillar of Autumn made a critical blind slipspace jump into the Soell system, Rawley found herself amidst chaos as Covenant forces boarded the ship. Rather than succumbing to panic, she swiftly led her squadron to safety, piloting her Pelican Echo 419 down to the surface of Installation 04 an alien structure found durring the blind jump, she would become an integral asset to the UNSC forces.</p>

        <h2>SN 11113-32871-DW Vice Admiral Danforth Whitcomb</h2>
        <p>
            Danforth Whitcomb was born on Earth on July 3, 2489, with claims of lineage tracing back to Russian Cossacks, though his accent suggested a Texan origin. His military journey during the Human-Covenant War was marked by significant battles, including the Battle of New Constantinople and the Siege of the Atlas Moons. His exemplary service was well-documented, with every SPARTAN-II studying his extensive record. In addition to his combat experience, Whitcomb directed several notable ONI projects, such as the HRUNTING and YGGDRASIL research and development programs.
            
            In 2552, Whitcomb found himself stationed at Reach, where he was deeply involved in a secret project: the NOVA bomb. As the Fall of Reach unfolded, he was determined to secure his project when the HIGHCOM HQ was destroyed. Whitcomb assumed command as the highest-ranking officer on the planet, desperately trying to coordinate efforts to gather the bombs. His radio communications revealed that his team, Charlie Company, had been overrun while defending ODG Facility A-331, leading to most of their deaths due to a tragic miscommunication involving friendly fire from C709 Longsword interceptors.
            
            In a twist of fate, Whitcomb reached out to Frederic-104, who was in charge of Charlie Company. Frederic deployed Spartans Anton-044, Li-008, and Grace-093 to rescue him. With heavy losses mounting, Whitcomb and the Spartans retreated to Camp Independence, where they conducted hit-and-run missions against Covenant forces while broadcasting the Oly Oly Oxen Free signal.
            
            Ascendant Justice and Tactical Sacrifice
            Whitcomb’s leadership continued as he took command of the Ascendant Justice/Gettysburg. Demonstrating strategic prowess, he navigated the ship through a Slipspace bubble, defeating Covenant forces despite the ship suffering significant damage. Facing the Covenant’s main attack force, Whitcomb recognized the dire situation. He made the heart-wrenching decision to abandon the rebels he had promised to protect, reasoning that their lives were expendable to save countless others on Earth.
            
            His famous quote before the retreat encapsulated his resolve: "This is not the Alamo and I am not Colonel William Barret Travis... No, we're running. We're trading hundreds of lives for millions." Whitcomb's tactical decision allowed him to return to the UNSC with vital intelligence, albeit at a moral cost.</p>
            
            <h2>Operation: FIRST STRIKE</h2>
           <p> Reluctantly, Whitcomb approved Operation: FIRST STRIKE, a countermeasure against the looming Covenant threat. After reassessing the situation, he realized the necessity of immediate action and devised a plan to exploit the Covenant's forces by creating a diversion. He orchestrated a maneuver that involved slingshotting the Ascendant Justice around a nearby moon toward the Unyielding Hierophant, effectively baiting the enemy into a trap.
            
            In a bold and heroic act, Whitcomb rammed the Unyielding Hierophant, broadcasting a message to the Covenant that he possessed the Forerunner crystal they sought. This tactic drew in numerous Covenant ships, leading to a catastrophic explosion that claimed the lives of Whitcomb, Lieutenant Haverson, and the Ascendant Justice. His sacrifice turned the tide, preventing an overwhelming invasion of Earth and inflicting significant losses on the Covenant fleet.</p>
            
            <h2>Legacy and the NOVA Bomb</h2>
            <p>In a haunting twist of fate, a NOVA bomb he had engineered would later wreak havoc on a Covenant-glassed world. The Covenant discovered the device, inadvertently activating it, leading to the destruction of the entire population of the planet and its moon. This act not only showcased the devastating potential of Whitcomb's designs but also solidified his legacy as one of the most impactful figures in the UNSC, with a kill count that rivaled even the legendary SPARTAN Program possibly surpassing it.
            
            Whitcomb’s final words echoed his complex legacy, emphasizing sacrifice, duty, and the heavy toll of war. His contributions to the UNSC and his ultimate sacrifice remain a testament to his unwavering commitment to humanity’s survival against overwhelming odds.</p>
