    <h2>The C.A.A.</h2>
    <p>The Colonial Administration Authority was established by the Unified Earth Government in 2310, alongside the now defunct Colonial Military Authority. Formed two decades after the invention of the Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine, the CAA was tasked with planning for humanity's extra-solar settlement and colonization, spending the following decades preparing for the inevitable exodus from the Sol system that would occur. The Domus Diaspora began as colony ships left Sol to settle worlds in other systems, beginning with Reach and Tribute in the Epsilon Eridani system.

        Prior to the onset of the Insurrection, many individuals felt sympathy for the rebels, blaming the Colonial Authority's bureaucrats for their increasingly poor understanding of the unique challenges among the Outer Colonies. However, as more radical insurgent factions abandoned politics, negotiations, and protesting for violence, targeting military infrastructure and key CAA supporters, support for the rebels soon died out as their actions grew more extreme. CAA buildings and personnel were heavily targeted by rebels late in the war. In 2497, the CMA was reorganized and absorbed into the United Nations Space Command, following a series of scandals throughout the Insurrection.
        
        Over the course of the Human-Covenant War, the Unified Earth Government granted substantial authority to the UNSC as a result of emergency powers and breakdown of interstellar governance. The CAA was more resistant to the takeover than the UEG proper, and thus it was stripped of most of its power. Despite this, the CAA Factbook was still being updated as late as 2550. Following the Covenant War, power was restored to the UEG and the CAA returned to its administrative duties as a division of the UEG.</p>

       <h2>Organization and powers</h2>
       <p>The Colonial Administration Authority serves as the administrative body for the colonies of the Unified Earth Government. In this capacity, the CAA governes the colonies in the UEG's name, its bureaucrats aiding in the management of population and employment, providing power for new colonies, and ensuring the quality of colonial infrastructure. However, colonies maintained sovereignty to some degree, as mandated by the Colonial Authority's own charter. The CAA has kept extensive files on every colony, world, and city under its care. The document containing these files was referred to as the CAA Factbook.</p>
       <img src="images/CAA_1.webp" alt="caa Factbook">
       <p> These files contained everything from topographic maps to the information on the materials the city sewer system was built from. The CAA provided this information to UNSC military forces upon request, and it was very helpful when defending colonies from Covenant attack. In addition, the CAA oversaw the Outer Colony vaccination program which held the largest DNA database of the human population. The Colonial Military Authority served as the military and policing arm of the CAA, until it was folded into the United Nations Space Command in 2497. The CAA was also responsible for the colonization of worlds, as evident by the "CAA" ship prefix on their colony ships, such as CAA Butterworth and CAA Casbah.</p>

        <h2>Interplanetary age</h2>
        <p>The concept of space colonization was born out of the need to expand human habitation outside of Earth to prevent overpopulation, to alleviate the consumption of Earth's resources by conducting planetary mining on other worlds, and to better understand the universe as human civilization expanded. Various approaches were suggested to achieve this, such as colonization efforts of the Moon and Mars, building facilities on orbiting asteroids and creating artificial platforms.

            The first recorded success of human colonization in the modern age was made in the later half of the 21st century, more specifically in 2080. The Moon and Mars saw humanity's first expansion, followed by a number of asteroids and the natural satellites orbiting Jupiter. The rapid pace of interplanetary colonization was driven by commercial interests more than the efforts on the part of national governments: Earth bio- and nanotechnology corporations sought to conduct scientific research unhindered by Earth's international law as well as its gravity. Mars, in particular, quickly became an important hub of leading-edge science and industry, and would continue to be so for hundreds of years, particularly in the area of spaceship manufacturing. Advancements in terraforming technologies transformed many of the formerly inhospitable planets and moons of the Solar System into worlds capable of sustaining life.
            
            Despite these successes, the efforts did not solve Earth's overpopulation issue. It eventually led to political unrest, contributing to the formation of political movements promising independence from the national governments on Earth and the perceived oppression by the United Nations. Operating across the colonized worlds and orbital platforms of the Sol system, the Frieden movement and the Koslovics were the most prominent of these rebel factions. Beginning with a Frieden attack on the United Nations Colonial Advisors in the Jovian Moons and the subsequent UN response, battles were fought over the colony worlds—as well as Earth itself—from 2160 to 2170, culminating in a UN victory in the Interplanetary War. The outcome of the space wars led to the establishment of the Unified Earth Government as a centralized governing body tasked to ensure Earth's influence over the colony worlds and a powerful, united military force known as the United Nations Space Command.
        </p>
        <p>(Note: After the war with the Covenant, many surviving records of our colonies are either inconsistent, incomplete, or even unreliable resulting in numerous entries being either missing or partially incomplete the documents relating to glassed planets or "Glasslands", As of January 2553, have been moved to the glasslands section of the glassings page. this list includes planets that we have lost contact or that we at the (CAA) believes to be lost. However, this list is subject to change as more insormatin is made known.

            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth, also known as Sol III, is the third planet and one of four terrestrial worlds in the Sol system. It is the presumptive homeworld of the human species, though some ancient humans disputed this due to lost records during technological dark ages and the presence of human ruins on other worlds. Earth is the capital world of the Unified Earth Government and home to the headquarters of the United Nations Space Command.

                With a population of around ten billion, Earth was the most populated planet in UEG territory prior to the Covenant invasion. Despite significant population loss due to the Covenant attack and a large-scale evacuation, the population rose to several billion again by the end of 2553.</p>

            <h2>Luna</h2>
            <p>Luna, often referred to as the Moon, is the only natural satellite of Earth. Luna is home to a large human population and the renowned Luna OCS Academy. Luna houses a number of skyhook defense complexes suspended in its low orbit. Luna is also the name generally used to refer to the populated colonies across the moon. Human beings took their first steps on Luna in 1969. By 1971, US Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Dean Mitchell was the 6th human to have walked on the moon. Humans began settling on Luna around 2080. During the Interplanetary War, Vladimir Koslov and his family were killed in a bombing at Lake Autolycus on Luna. The Colonial Administration Authority had the Odyssey along with hundreds of Phoenix-class colony ships and Euphrates-class colony ships made over Luna.The Domus Diaspora was launched from Luna in 2362.

                By 2492, a governing body of Luna was known as Luna Confederated States, the State of Mare Nubium being one of the said states. The Academy at Mare Nubium, known more generally as the Luna OCS Academy, was located here. </p>

            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars, also known as Sol IV, is the fourth planet of the Sol system, and one of four terrestrial worlds. One of the first human interplanetary colonies,Mars is a major industrial center and one of the largest in the Sol system.Mars is home to the UNSC Navy's primary shipyards and the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers' headquarters in the city of Kenosha, Tanais. In 2080, Mars became the first planet colonized by humanity during the late 21st century's wave of interplanetary colonization. Driven by corporations seeking to escape Earth's gravity and legal constraints, Mars quickly evolved into a hub for industry and advanced scientific research, particularly in nano- and biotechnologies. Robotics-driven manufacturing and spacecraft construction flourished, especially in the Argyre Planitia region. Even before terraforming, Mars was one of the largest industrial centers in the Sol system. With advancements in terraforming technology, it transformed into a planet with near-Earth conditions, attracting many settlers. In the 22nd century, a man from Mars led a failed habitat-ship project, fleeing to the Amazon, where he misled the uncontacted Khabnathwa people into believing he was their god-king, ultimately leading to the destruction of their culture.  </p>

<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Mars is one of the most industrialized worlds in human space, second only to Earth and Reach. It hosts a critical shipyard complex, particularly after the Fall of Reach, with the Martian Metals Shipyards and Aerofabrique SA present. The surface features massive road trains for transporting cargo between cities. Misriah Armory, the largest military weapons manufacturer in human history, is based here, along with Acheron Security. Additionally, a boutique firm developed the Envy VISR but delayed sharing it with the UNSC due to its anti-military stance. Mars is also known for producing a unique whiskey enjoyed by Michael Stanforth.</p>

            <h2>Barrow (Eta 7 Sigma c)</h2>
            <p>Barrow boasts a rich and storied history, both politically and environmentally. The system was first confirmed in 2350 and became a site of colonization in 2412. Early settlers quickly realized that Barrow was a unique world in its own right. Over the past century and a half, the planet's scientific community has consistently returned from expeditions with remarkable discoveries, showcasing its incredible diversity.</p>
            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p>Barrow, only lightly tectonically active, is experiencing early continental drift, approximately 2 billion years behind Earth. Its original supercontinent, Premoire Terre, is believed to have split into two major plates: Premiore Pulimias (Primary Crescent) and Occiderram (West Land), with a third landmass, Yuig Reichei (South Reach), forming in the Antarctic region. As the plates separate, biodiversity is expected to increase, aided by mountain ranges that divide land and create unique ecosystems.</p>
            <h4>Notable Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Premiore Pulimias:</strong> Contains the Cascadia Super-Range, a vast mountain range rich in titanium, and Cascadian Bay, a mega harbor essential for aquaculture and storm protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Premoire Boreal:</strong> A thick boreal rainforest covering about 4 million square miles.</li>
                <li><strong>Lesser Boreal:</strong> Slightly smaller, this rainforest is crucial for breeding marine mammals.</li>
                <li><strong>Occiderram:</strong> Home to the Breach Salt Marsh, a biodiversity hotspot, and the Noirge Desert, a harsh volcanic region.</li>
                <li><strong>Yuig Reichei:</strong> A dormant supervolcano with extensive cave systems supporting a unique ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Planetary System</h4>
            <p>Barrow has one moon, Rye, a small, rust-colored companion, crucial for various installations.</p>
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Barrow features temperate rainforests and arctic tundra, with an average temperature of 11.1°C. The equator experiences temperatures around 23°C (77°F) during the day and drops to 14°C (59°F) at night.</p>
            <h4>Life and Biology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monkola:</strong>An intelligent native species resembling a mix of koalas and spider monkeys.</li>
                <li><strong>Haulker:</strong> A large mammalian species native to Barrow, the Haulker is used unironically in farming areas for its hauling capacity, females are also used for their milk and the livestock animal has lead to many Barrow-original home meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Jackalope:</strong> Barrow's own myth come to reality is the Jackalope which bears a striking resemblance to the 20th century popularized fictional TaunTaun especially in winter when its wooly white coat grows in. The males of the species also feature antelope like horns which serve a variety of roles for farmers and livestock families. The Jackalope stands nearly ten feet tall with females usually between eight and nine feet in height. Jackalopes are used for their light hauling capacity, moderate ridability, meat, milk, and ivory in low amounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Wildermoose:</strong>The Wildermoose, resembling an Earth moose, is a highly territorial creature known for aggressively asserting dominance over even deceased opponents. This behavior may help it mark territory by embedding its scent in the environment. Herds of Wildermoose roam cold, hilly regions or form small family units in forests.

                    In Barrow's arctic regions, most animals are woolly or have dense fur to survive the cold, while marine life relies on blubber for warmth. Only animals near the equator may lack fur, and even they often have patchy coverage. </li>
                <li><strong>Noirge Fox:</strong>The Noirge Fox, native to the Noirge Desert, shows significant adaptation among Barrow's mammals, resembling marsupials. Its evolutionary traits may be due to limited competition and resources, leading to shorter gestation periods. Similar to squirrels, these foxes hide in volcanic crevices. Their horn-like skulls are crucial for detecting storms and other ecological signals via ultra- and infrasonic sounds, enabling them to communicate in ways that evade predators. </li>

Tribute is one of the most prominent commercial colonies in all of human-occupied space, with a large population and thriving spaceport traffic. Its strong economy was centered around the planet's large industrial capacity. Tribute's fall to the Covenant in 2552 was considered to be one of the tragedies of the Human-Covenant War, which resulted in huge economic ramifications on Earth and the surviving colonies in the post-war period. However, the planet was not completely lost and its surviving residents have begun to rebuild Tribute's once powerful economy. it is one of few planets that has been re-colonized after its glassing.</p>

            In 2535, at the time Lieutenant Jacob Keyes escorted a mission to this colony aboard the UNSC Midsummer Night. During this time, he lead escort of an exodus ship witch rescued an unprecedented number of servivors of the glassed planet Madrigal, this ship constructed from an astroid this "habitat Exodus" eventualy broke up creating a significant navigational hazard around the planet, which experts estimated would take years to clear. Following the evacuation of survivors from Exodus, many were placed in refugee camps throughout Falaknuma, with some quickly disappearing.
            
            On March 6, 2543, a minor skirmish occurred between a Sinaris-pattern heavy destroyer and Battle Group Sierra-3 in the 18 Scorpii system, where the UNSC Navy was supported by insurrectionist forces.</p>

            <p>Described as a "radiant sapphire," New Carthage boasts expansive blue oceans that conceal many dangerous species, including the notorious great red shark. The planet did not require terraforming to support human life, although it is home to vast stretches of hostile alien environments that have remained unexplored more than a century after its colonization. The landmasses of New Carthage feature weathered shale mountains, high alpine plains, and semi-arid grasslands and deserts.

                The Pori region is a notable area on New Carthage, housing the industrial township of Kotka. Here, a facility operated by Hannibal Weapon Systems developed various variants of the MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor, including the Vanguard and Aviator models. One significant landmark in Pori is the Pori Meteor, a massive shard of variegated rock approximately four stories tall. Its unique shape allows it to blend into the surrounding terrain, making its size all the more striking.
                
                The Hannibal family settled in the Pori region in 2474, likely discovering the meteor as they established the city of Pilvros, named after Jack Pilvros Hannibal. By 2505, the family recognized the meteor's significance and built a structure over both the meteor and the way station below. Research conducted on the meteor and the underground facility led to humanity's first small-scale quantum photonic amplifier for SATCOM relays, propelling Jack Hannibal into the spotlight and establishing Hannibal Weapon Systems as a lucrative enterprise. By 2558, the meteor had become the centerpiece of Hannibal HQ's main atrium.</p>
                <p>Notable Residents are the Hannibal Family including
                    Jack Hannibal: Businessman and founder of Hannibal Weapon Systems. The Hannibal family settled in the Inner Colony of New Carthage in 2474, establishing thirty acres in the Pori region. This land would develop into the bustling city of Pilvros. By 2505, the family constructed a building over the Pori Meteor and the buried Forerunner structure beneath it, later known as Hannibal HQ. After discovering the subterranean alien facility, Jack Hannibal developed the first small-scale quantum photonic amplifier for SATCOM relays within six years, revolutionizing interplanetary communication. Although hailed as a genius and a visionary, the public remained unaware of the Forerunner structure hidden beneath Hannibal HQ.</p>

                <h2>Beta Gabriel(Epsilon Eridani system)</h2>
                <p>Beta Gabriel is a serene resort planet located in the Epsilon Eridani system, characterized by its extensive blue oceans and lush forested nature preserves. The planet is teeming with life, including species that resemble Earth's whales and eels, particularly the enigmatic Paelosur and Qothal. The Qothal creatures are often colloquially referred to as "nightmare eels" and are typically found in the deep, dark waters of Beta Gabriel, rarely seen in shallower areas beyond their first year of life.
                Qothal are primarily hunted by three-meter-long crustaceans that inhabit the labyrinthine caverns covering the ocean floor. Paelosurs, another fascinating species of sightless cetaceans found in both Beta Gabriel and Alluvion strangely enough, its theorized that they were placed there by an alien species. They rely on their highly evolved echolocation to locate massive swarms of krill-like organisms, their main source of sustenance. As air-breathers, these creatures inhale and exhale through thousands of pores scattered across their bodies.</p>
                <p>During the invasion of the Epsilon Eridani system, two UNSC vessels, the Of Uncommon Courage and the Splendid Intention, were downed in the southern waters of Beta Gabriel. Despite the tumultuous events of the Human-Covenant War, the planet survived and is now seen as a tranquil tourist destination, attracting visitors eager to explore its natural beauty and rich marine life.</p>
                <p>The Aleutian Rim, a segment of the Cortez Ocean on Beta Gabriel, constructed on the sea floor is Fathom Station. This station was established in 2554 to examine the wreckage of the Covenant carrier, Splendid Intention, in search of weapon plans. Unfortunately, in 2556, the carrier unexpectedly shifted from its resting place, sliding down a trench and causing significant damage to Fathom Station. Today, Beta Gabriel is sparsely populated it being a vacation world, hosting a mere 500 residents. These inhabitants are not official colonists; instead, the planet has become an "outdoors getaway" for wealthy entrepreneurs. The limited infrastructure includes a basic landing port, a few rustic cabins, supply shops, and a community lodge where visitors can engage in activities like hunting, hiking, and spiritual quests. The planet also serves as the self-imposed exile location for Dasc Gevadim, a human spiritualist and founder of the Triad, who withdrew from public life to cultivate the impression of having achieved transcendence.

                    Beta Gabriel stands as a testament to resilience and the beauty of nature, inviting those who seek adventure and tranquility in the cosmos</p>

        <h2>Alluvion (Bhaakto III)</h2>
        <p>Alluvion, also known as Bhaakto III, is the third planet in the Bhaakto system and a former human Outer Colony of the Unified Earth Government. Once bustling with life and home to millions, Alluvion faced devastation during the Human-Covenant War when it was glassed by Covenant forces in 2543. By 2554, however, the planet underwent recolonization.</p>
        <p>Before its destruction, Alluvion boasted vast oceans and a moderately tropical climate. The planet's aggressive tidal forces, primarily caused by its moon Fallow, forced many population centers to establish themselves inland, away from the coasts. Colonized by the Unified Earth Government in 2412, Alluvion was considered a border world and an important waystation between the Inner Colonies and the emerging Outer Colonies. Its colonization marked the beginning of humanity's expansion into the Outer Colonies. Covenant scouting patrols located Alluvion in 2541, leading to a full-scale invasion commanded by Thel 'Vadamee in 2542. During the Battle for Alluvion, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) mounted a substantial defense, managing to hold off Covenant forces for weeks. However, a support fleet quickly severed the planet's critical supply lines, and Alluvion fell shortly thereafter. Many of its human inhabitants, including Spartan Gabriel Thorne's parents—UNSC Army officers stationed on the planet—perished in the glassing event. By 2544, Alluvion was devoid of human life, with major population centers and spaceports obliterated. On September 26, 2552, Alluvion was cited as an example of planets that had suffered glassing, though it was noted that only the large cities were destroyed, leaving much of the planet relatively preserved.

            In 2554, a recolonization support fleet from the Unified Earth Government returned to Alluvion. Upon arrival, they discovered an unusual anomaly beneath the Sundark Sea—Forerunner shield pylons that had long been hidden from the colony’s inhabitants. These pylons emerged and pushed back massive walls of water, revealing the seafloor and exposing a hidden repository containing an exotic fuel source believed to have the potential to replace deuterium for human starship propulsion.
            
            The UNSC contracted the Liang-Dortmund Corporation to further investigate this discovery. In 2556, their aerospace division established the Alluvion Research Center to explore the new energy source, attempting to power prototype Nordica V shuttles. However, a year into their research, mining operations triggered the withdrawal of the shield pylons, causing a catastrophic collapse of the sea above and trapping those inside the facility.</p>
            <h2>Sundark Sea</h2>
            <p>In 2554, when the UEG returned to Alluvion to recolonize the planet after its fall in 2542, the recolonization support fleet discovered the now-activated pylons in Sundark Sea that forced back massive walls of water and revealed the seafloor. After several years of surveying this area, an exploration team discovered the exotic fuel source and estimated that it was capable of replacing deuterium for human starships. Contacted by the United Nations Space Command, the Liang-Dortmund Corporation established the Alluvion Research Center within the sea in 2556, seeking to directly power a number of prototype shuttles with this newfound energy source. However, a year into their research, Liang-Dortmund's mining efforts mysteriously triggered the complete withdrawal of the shield pylons and the Sundark Sea collapsed on all who remained within the ARC.</p>

            <h2>Neos Atlantis(Alcides system)</h2>
            <p>Neos Atlantis is a planet located in the Alcides system and serves as a human colony of the Unified Earth Government. Situated in an ambiguous zone between the Inner and Outer Colonies, it features a distinctive green, icy surface that adds to its unique character. One of the planet's most notable features is the Theran Crown, a gloomy, spire-studded cryovolcano surrounded by imposing green ice cliffs. The presence of this cryovolcano highlights the planet's geological activity and adds a dramatic landscape to the region. Although Neos Atlantis is equipped with surface habitats, these habitats are sealed from the exterior due to the planet's toxic atmosphere, necessitating specialized environments for human survival. In March 2526, during the early stages of the Human-Covenant War, the 11th Marine Force Reconnaissance/ODST was stationed on Neos Atlantis. This unit played a crucial role before moving on to engage the emerging Covenant threat in the Outer Colonies. Notably, Lieutenant Commander Clovis Petriv of the Incident Response and Investigation branch and Captain Laru of the UNSC Donoma attended a senior leadership course on the planet together, highlighting its strategic importance during the war. The name "Neos Atlantis" translates to "Young Atlantis" in Greek, hinting at the planet's potential for growth and development. The green ice surrounding the Theran Crown may indicate the presence of algae-like organisms, suggesting the possibility of life. Alternatively, the discoloration could be attributed to impurities such as sediments or air bubbles. Neos Atlantis is classified as a high-security world, surrounded by orbital maintenance docks designated solely for United Nations Space Command military vessels. These installations employ approximately 100,000 civilian technicians, contributing to the planet's security and operational capacity. The UNSC has also established recreational facilities on Neos Atlantis, which are exclusively reserved for fleet personnel due to ongoing security concerns. Additionally, the planet's military installations feature a Commander's Spa, designed for the relaxation and leisure of UNSC commissioned officers.

        In summary, Neos Atlantis stands as a critical hub within the Alcides system, combining military significance with the potential for scientific exploration and development.</p>

<h2>Mamore(Mamore system)</h2>
<p>Mamore was a human colony significantly affected by the Insurrection, experiencing frequent rebel attacks against both military and civilian targets. In 2511, the colony suffered a devastating terrorist attack when a bomber from the Freedom and Liberation Party detonated a commercial nuclear explosive in the Haven arcology. This catastrophic event resulted in the deaths of 2 million people and left 8.3 million others injured.

    The magnitude of the attack prompted the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) to increase its military presence on Mamore to counter the insurgent threat. Among those deployed were the parents of Chyler Silva, both of whom served in the UNSC military. As part of this response, Silva's family relocated to Mamore. Tragically, both of her parents were later killed in action during operations against rebel forces.
    
    The Haven arcology, located in the Mato Grosso province on Mamore, was a significant urban structure before its destruction. The loss of the arcology not only marked a severe blow to the colony's infrastructure but also underscored the intense volatility and dangers present on Mamore during the height of the Insurrection.</p>

        <h2>Carrow/Rakoi(Holdhome system)</h2>
        <p>Carrow, known to the Sangheili as Rakoi, is a planet that was once a human Outer Colony and is now part of a Joint-Occupation Zone shared between humans and Sangheili. Following the end of the Human-Covenant War and the Great Schism, it became a unique example of coexistence between the two species.</p>
        <h3>Geography and Settlements</h3>
        <p>Carrow features a single dominant landmass characterized by the expansive Uldt Desert, which stretches between the two primary centers of governance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suraka:</strong> The human capital city with a population of around one million people. Suraka is notable for its distinct skyline of skyscrapers and is divided into multiple sectors, including agricultural areas and a financial district that houses the city's stock exchange in the Wulandari Building. Various businesses operate here, such as Rughet Factories and Finlay Ice Creams.</li>
            <li><strong>Rak:</strong> A Sangheili city-state founded by Rojka 'Kaasan and his followers seeking a fresh start after the Great Schism. Located along the hidden Astlehich River in the Uldt Desert, Rak grew from initial holds into a significant settlement for the Sangheili on Carrow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Between Suraka and Rak lies the Uldt Desert, featuring vast sand dunes in the south and rocky terrains with mountain ranges like the Karfu Mountains in the north. The Carstolum River, now a dried-up streambed, runs along the eastern side of the desert near Suraka. Various oases are scattered throughout the desert, including Masov Oasis, controlled by the Sangheili and situated midway between Rak and the human settlement of Sandholm.</p>
        <p><strong>Sandholm</strong> was established by human refugees from the Human-Covenant War who intended to settle near the Astlehich River. Finding the area already inhabited by the Sangheili and unable to relocate, they founded Sandholm 140 kilometers from Rak, carving out a life in the harsh desert environment.</p>
        <p>Originally a lush planet with abundant rivers, Carrow underwent ecological changes that transformed much of its landscape into desert. Established as an Outer Colony of the Unified Earth Government, Suraka began as a small oasis settlement and expanded over time.

            In the aftermath of the Human-Covenant War, Carrow was designated as part of a Joint-Occupation Zone. The Unified Earth Government permitted Sangheili settlers led by Rojka 'Kaasan to establish Rak, while also facilitating the return of human colonists to Suraka. This arrangement led to a unique coexistence between humans and Sangheili on the planet.
            
            While occasional tensions existed, Carrow stands as a testament to the potential for cooperation and peaceful coexistence between the two species in the post-war era.

        <h2>Chi Ceti IV</h2>
        <p>Chi Ceti IV, known to the Covenant as Chelav, is a human Outer Colony located in the Chi Ceti system. The planet is orbited by two natural satellites, one of which is Muroto, a habitable moon rich in resources used for creating data crystal chips. Despite its volatile and treacherous environment, Chi Ceti IV is suitable for human habitation. Colonized in 2430, Chi Ceti IV became significant due to the establishment of the Damascus Materials Testing Facility by the Office of Naval Intelligence's Materials Group in the region of Vhalkem. This facility played a crucial role in the development and testing of the MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor, the advanced exoskeleton used by Spartan super-soldiers. On November 27, 2525, the Covenant light cruiser Unrelenting arrived in the Chi Ceti system. The UNSC frigate Commonwealth engaged the enemy vessel, resulting in heavy damage to both ships. While the Commonwealth remained in orbit, Spartan-II soldiers received their MJOLNIR armor from the Damascus facility.

            Later that day, Spartans John-117, Kelly-087, and Samuel-034 undertook a mission to board and destroy the Unrelenting. During the operation, Samuel-034's armor was compromised, preventing his return to the Commonwealth. Choosing to sacrifice himself, he detonated an ANVIL-II missile, destroying the Covenant ship and himself. Following this event, the Damascus facility and a nearby UNSC training center were abandoned due to the Covenant threat. In 2527, the Covenant returned to attack Chi Ceti IV, but the planet was neither destroyed nor the facility permanently lost. Chi Ceti IV survived the Human-Covenant War and continues to support the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). The Damascus Materials Testing Facility remains operational, contributing to the development of MJOLNIR GEN2 armor variants, including the Soldier variant. Additionally, Muroto is utilized by the Office of Naval Intelligence for mining operations. Chi Ceti IV remains a vital asset to humanity's military and technological advancement, reflecting resilience and strategic importance in the ongoing efforts to maintain peace and security in the galaxy.

        <h2>Concord(Alabaster system)</h2>
        <p>Concord is a human Outer Colony located in the Alabaster system and operates under the authority of the Unified Earth Government (UEG). The planet is notable for its prominent polar caps that dominate both the northern and southern hemispheres. Between these icy extremes lies an equatorial habitable band that offers a mild and pleasant climate, featuring alpine forests that undergo seasonal changes between winter and summer months. Outside of this band, the hinterlands present a hostile environment that is sparsely populated, mainly by miners and hardy isolationists who prefer solitude.</p>

           <p> The largest landmass on Concord is Corsica, which is home to the megacity of Lethbridge. This city serves as the headquarters for Lethbridge Industrial, a major manufacturing firm that has significantly invested in the planet's infrastructure and development. In late 2551, the Caravelle Province, located south of the equator, was cleared of Covenant presence during Operation: GYPSUM. On December 5, 2551, there were reports of Covenant activity near Lethbridge Industrial's combat fields just outside Lethbridge.</p>
            
           <p> In the northern region of Concord, the Bristol Sea is a significant body of water adjacent to Bristol Bay. Longbow Station, a research facility with twin mass drivers extending over the sea, is situated just off the coast. Initially commissioned in 2509, Longbow Station played a pivotal role in launching deep-space monitoring relays to study distant star systems. The station's location in the frigid tundra, coupled with gravitational conditions, enhanced the effectiveness of its mass drivers. With the onset of the Human-Covenant War, Longbow Station was adapted to house key military sensors used to track Covenant fleet movements. During the 2551 defense of Concord, its mass drivers were repurposed as improvised anti-orbital artillery, disabling Covenant ships and allowing a UNSC battle group to finish off the invading fleet. Recurve Station, a sister facility located in the mountains, served similar purposes.</p>
            
           <p> Within the equatorial band lies the Hinterlands Region, characterized by alpine forests and housing three townships: Ploh, Skathi, and New Ugga. These towns are predominantly inhabited by civilian mining personnel and isolationist settlers who prefer the rugged lifestyle away from urban centers. Skathi is the least developed, consisting of wooden houses, a tavern, a lumber mill, and a few general stores focused on general supplies and hunting goods. On December 12, 2551, Skathi was the site of a skirmish between NOBLE Team and Covenant ground forces.
            
            Concord was originally considered a marginal prospect for colonization but was settled in 2490 due to its strategic position along multiple slipspace routes and extensive mineral wealth. Lethbridge Industrial and settlement cooperatives from the Sol system's Jovian colonies were instrumental in its development. Prior to 2525, facilities like Longbow Station were used for peaceful endeavors, such as launching star surveys. However, with the outbreak of the Human-Covenant War, Concord experienced a surge in population as refugees from evacuated colonies settled on the planet. The UEG heavily invested in its infrastructure, transforming outposts into burgeoning cities. Original settlers who had lived on Concord for decades often chose to move into the harsher wilderness areas, preferring isolation over the rapidly urbanizing environments.
            </p>
            <p>In December 2551, the Covenant attacked Concord. The planet's civilian industrial mass driver facilities, including Longbow and Recurve stations, were converted for military use as anti-orbital artillery. These efforts were sufficient to disable the Covenant fleet, allowing UNSC naval forces to eliminate the threat and strand enemy ground forces. Concordian citizens formed their own militia forces to defend their home. Despite the attack, Lethbridge Industrial continued to operate and invest in Concord, contributing to its recovery and ongoing development. Today, Concord remains a significant industrial hub with continuous growth projects, exemplifying human resilience and strategic ingenuity.
            
            The planet has two moons, Mesker and Ophilia, though detailed information about them is limited. Concord's transformation from a marginal colony into a thriving world underscores its importance within human-controlled space, both strategically and industrially. Its ability to successfully defend against Covenant forces highlights the determination and resourcefulness of its inhabitants.

        <h2>EridanusII(Eridanus system)</h2>
        <p>Eridanus II is a human Outer Colony planet situated in the Eridanus system, first settled in 2440. Renowned for its mostly rural landscape, the planet is devoid of pollution and overcrowding, featuring climate-controlled weather that enhances its natural beauty. Eridanus II gained fame for its stunning landscapes and esteemed centers of higher learning, attracting settlers and visitors alike.

            The planet has one natural satellite named Ehilend. With a gravity of 1.01 G and an atmosphere composed of nitrogen and oxygen—mirroring Earth's atmospheric composition—Eridanus II provides a familiar environment for human inhabitants. The surface temperature ranges from -18°C to 38°C (0.4°F to 100.4°F), accommodating a variety of climates and ecosystems. Following the events of the Human-Covenant War, the post-war population of Eridanus II is approximately 510,000 residents. This population consists of rehabilitation pioneers and original inhabitants who returned to rebuild their communities.
            
            Eridanus II is home to the cities of Luxor and Elysium City, both significant urban centers. Elysium City, where the legendary Spartan-II supersoldier John-117 (also known as Master Chief) grew up, is renowned for its premier gravball league. The name "Elysium" is derived from the Latinization of the Greek word "Elysion," meaning paradise—a reference to the Elysian Fields of mythology, where heroes and the virtuous reside in eternal happiness.
            
            Gravball, a sport played using a levitating ball on a repulsor court, is a popular pastime on Eridanus II. By 2558, gravball had become the most popular competitive sport across human space for nearly a century, with Elysium City's league leading in prominence. now that the war is over and Elysium city being rebuilt the league is running again.
            
            Luxor, another major city on Eridanus II, hosts the Luxor Spaceport, a crucial starship hub that has been rebuilt along with the city after destruction during the Human-Covenant War. The spaceport's proximity to Elysium City facilitates travel and trade between the two locales, contributing to the planet's economic recovery and growth. Lake Gusev is another notable landmark, adding to the planet's picturesque environment.
            
            During the Human-Covenant War, Eridanus II faced significant challenges. In 2530, the planet was attacked and glassed by Covenant forces, leading to its abandonment by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Despite the devastation, the planet remained largely intact due to incomplete glassing, allowing for the possibility of future reclamation. At some point during the war, Operation: BLUE MOON took place on Eridanus II, though details of this operation remain scarce.
            
            By 2557, efforts to reclaim and resettle the planet had gained significant momentum. The UNSC facilitated these efforts, ensuring security and providing resources for reconstruction. Services like those offered by Nova Austin Station on the planet Cascade began providing flights to Eridanus II, highlighting its restored importance within human space.
            
            Eridanus II's history is a testament to human resilience and determination. From its idyllic beginnings through the trials of war and eventual resurgence, the planet embodies the spirit of recovery and the enduring pursuit of a better future. The combination of favorable environmental conditions, cultural richness, and strategic efforts in rebuilding has reestablished Eridanus II as a beacon of hope and progress in the post-war era.</p>
