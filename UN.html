        <h2>About the UNSC Navy</h2>
        <p>The United Nations Space Command Navy (UNSC Navy) is the space-based branch of the military forces of the UNSC, responsible for commanding naval vessels and spacecraft in military engagements. Space warfare evolved with the invention of space travel in the 20th century, leading to military operations beyond Earth's surface. By the late 21st century, humanity had established colonies in space, and conflicts like the Interplanetary War saw the formation of the UNSC Navy after the Mars Campaign.

            In the late 23rd century, the invention of the Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine allowed ships to travel vast distances through slipspace. Initially focused on low-level operations like anti-piracy, the UNSC Navy shifted to full-scale space warfare during the Insurrection. The Callisto Incident in 2494 sparked numerous space engagements between the UNSC and Insurrectionists, shaping modern space combat.
            
            The UNSC Navy played a crucial role in defending humanity during the Human-Covenant War, adapting to face the advanced Covenant forces. The Covenant had been spacefaring for millennia, as early as 938 BCE.
            
            Despite being outmatched, the UNSC Navy evolved and developed new strategies, like the keys loop becoming a vital component of humanity’s defense. Through innovation and resilience, the Navy continues to protect humanity's colonies, ensuring peace in the galaxy.
