        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p> "First to Fight." — UNSC Marine Corps Credo

            The UNSC Marine Corps stands as one of the most formidable and resilient branches of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), with a proud tradition of being the first into battle. This elite force is responsible for executing land-based expeditionary, amphibious, and airborne combat operations, often on the front lines of humanity's defense. Utilizing the swift mobility of the UNSC Navy, Marines are deployed rapidly across galaxies, ready to engage and neutralize threats wherever they arise.
            
            In addition to their combat roles, UNSC Marines are entrusted with the critical task of defending Navy vessels and installations from hostile forces, ensuring the safety of vital infrastructure and personnel. Although structured under the Unified Ground Command, the Marine Corps operates in close coordination with the UNSC Naval Command, often assuming joint authority in strategic operations. As one of the five esteemed uniformed services of the UNSC Armed Forces, the Marine Corps continues to lead the charge, upholding humanity's last line of defense across the stars. </p>

        <h3>Origins and Formation</h3>
        <p> The United States Marine Corps paved the way for the formidable UNSC Marine Corps. As the fires of the Interplanetary War ignited in the 2160s, governments across the Sol system ramped up their military might. Yet, disorganization plagued their scattered forces, causing chaos among the ranks. In response, the United Nations stepped in and, in 2163, formed a new and elite fighting force: the United Nations Space Command, complete with its powerful Navy and its indomitable Marine Corps.

            Born from the fusion of naval and spaceborne expeditionary units from across the globe, the UNSC Marine Corps stood as a united, unstoppable force. Their first great test came in December 2163, when the enemy struck at the heart of humanity's shipbuilding efforts on Mars. The UNSC Marines, forged in fire and steel, launched a series of lightning-fast assaults, overwhelming the enemy forces near Argyre Planitia. It was humanity’s first extraterrestrial military engagement, and the Marines emerged victorious.
            
            This resounding victory solidified the UNSC Marine Corps as the galaxy’s premier fighting force. From then on, UNSC Navy warships would carry battalions of these battle-hardened warriors, ready to strike fear into the heart of any enemy. Recruitment surged, and propaganda rallied entire generations to join their ranks. By 2170, the UNSC had crushed the forces threatening Earth, and the Marines were celebrated as humanity’s saviors. They remain the sword and shield of the UNSC, prepared to defend all of mankind against any threat, no matter how distant or how dire. </p> 
            <h3>The Insurrection</h3>
            <p>From 2494 to 2525, the UNSC Marine Corps was the first line of defense against Insurrectionist uprisings across UNSC colonies and star systems. By 2512, the Marines found themselves engaged in one of the largest and most significant operations in their storied history—Operation: TREBUCHET. This daring campaign aimed to crush rebel forces in the volatile Eridanus and Epsilon Eridani star systems, where insurgent activities had reached a fever pitch.

                The fearless 9th Marine Expeditionary Force was dispatched to Eridanus II, with orders to capture rebel leaders and restore order. One of these elite units, the 1st Battalion of the 21st Marine Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ponder, embarked on a high-stakes mission in Elysium City. Their goal: to capture the second-in-command of the rebel forces. But the operation took a tragic turn, ending in a devastating loss—rebel leader's family members were killed, and Ponder himself was wounded and subsequently demoted. 
                
                By 2524, the rebellion had spread to the colony world of Tribute. There, a determined Marine battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Aboim and backed by the UNSC corvette *Bum Rush*, along with AV-14 Hornet air support, took on the daunting task of halting rebel bomb makers operating near the city of Casbah. In a fateful operation, two special warfare squads—under the command of the legendary Staff Sergeants Avery Johnson and Nolan Byrne—found themselves in the midst of a catastrophic event. During a tense hostage situation at a local restaurant, Byrne's team suffered heavy losses. The operation ended in disaster, with thirty-eight civilians, three Marines, and two rebels losing their lives in the ensuing bombing. The grim toll only fueled the Marines' resolve to fight harder and protect humanity from the insurrectionist threat.</p>
                <h3>Human-Covenant War</h3>
                <p>The UNSC Marine Corps first encountered the alien Covenant at the horrific First Battle of Harvest in 2525. With only three Marine officers present, training the Colonial Militia, the Marines faced a fierce and relentless enemy. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Marines fought valiantly, with Captain Ponder becoming the Corps' first hero to fall in defense of humanity. His sacrifice marked the beginning of the Marine Corps' legendary stand against the alien threat.

                    After Harvest, the Marines proved time and again that they were humanity's shield. During the grueling Harvest Campaign from 2526 to 2531, the Marines established an arctic base on the planet, setting the stage for one of their most remarkable victories. Led by the fearless Sergeant John Forge, the Marines encountered a devastating Covenant assault under the ruthless Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee. Despite overwhelming odds, Forge rallied his scattered troops, retook the base, and held off the Covenant long enough for reinforcements to arrive. This victory wasn't just a battle won, but a message to the Covenant: humanity, and its Marines, would not fall easily.
                    
                    In the final weeks of 2525, the UNSC Marine Corps deployed en masse to Alpha Corvi II, tasked with defending its capital city from a Covenant onslaught. The Covenant came with superior firepower, but the Marines fought with unmatched tenacity. Their efforts were critical in diverting Covenant forces, allowing Blue Team to secure a crucial artifact. Though the battle came at a great cost, with over thirty percent casualties, the Marines proved once again that they would sacrifice everything to defend the future of humanity. Their bravery forced the Covenant to fight for every inch of ground, no matter the cost. </p>
