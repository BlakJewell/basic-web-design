            What is ONI
        </h2>

        <p style="font-size:120%;">
            The Office of Naval Intelligence was founded in 2178.
            One of the earliest known projects undertaken by ONI was in 2321. 
            This project, dubbed <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/ORION_Project" target="_blank">ORION</a>, was an attempt to increase the effectiveness of Colonial Military Authority soldiers. However this initial run was eventually postponed.
            In 2491. the Carver Findings released and ONI began to use it as their approach to the Insurrectionists. leading to 
            <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Operation:_TREBUCHET" target="_blank">Operation: TREBUCHET</a>
            Our operatives were instrumental in quelling the insurrectionist threat to the outer colonies ufotunately do to this theat we were unprepared when something far worse found us
            In 2517, candidates for the new Generation II ORION Project later the spartan II program were recruted from military personnel scouted in bootcamp and brought to Reach for training and later augmentation
            The Office of Naval Intelligence commonly shortened to ONI is the intelligence service of the United Nations Space Command Navy. Overtly, Oni is the information gathering and analysis division of the UNSC Naval Command. In reality, our operations are far broader than simple intelligence gathering.
            ONI in the War Against the Covenant
            In the first several months of the war, some ONI analysts believed the Covenant may have visited Earth in the past. Part of this was due to the meter and a half tall Unggoy the Covenant employed. As such, the Covenant received the nickname "LGM" or "Little Green Men".
            Over the course of the war, ONI eliminated or gained control over most competing civilian and military espionage services. for the greater good we could not have infighting durring such a volatile period. Some may find our methods extreme, but when faced with extinction, any alternative is preferable.
            post war
            Following the war, the Office of Naval Intelligence had become the primary intelligence service of the UEG. ONI was also afforded a great deal of autonomy, due to our work during the war with the UNSC Security Council. As of 2555, Admiral Margaret Parangosky was replaced with Admiral Serin Osman as Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence or CINCONI.
