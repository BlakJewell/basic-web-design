        <h1>The Enemy</h1>
        <p>("Your destruction is the will of the gods and we are their interment" belived to be the words of Truth at the start of the war)</p>
        <p>The Covenant, often referred to as the Covenant Empire or Covenant Hegemony, was a vast religious alliance that controlled a significant portion of the Orion Arm in the our Galaxy for thousands of years. Initially, it was a coalition between the San'Shyuum(Prophets) and the Sangheili(Elites)(henge heads), but over time, it expanded to include six other species: the Huragok, Mgalekgolo(Hunters), Unggoy(Grunts), Kig-Yar(Jackals), Yanme'e(Drones), and Jiralhanae(Brutes). These diverse species united in their worship of the mythological "Forerunners".

            By 2525, the Covenant was ruled by the High Prophet of Truth, Mercy, and Regret. During this period, they initiated a genocidal campaign against humanity that lasted nearly 30 Earth standard years, until their eventual defeat in December 2552. Despite being one of the most powerful military forces in the galaxy, the Covenant faced formidable challenges. Internal conflicts, coupled with our relentless resistance, ultimately shattered the unity of the empire. This led to a significant division, particularly resulting in the expulsion of the Sangheili(Elites).
            
            After the Covenant's collapse at the Battle of the Citadel, some loyalists managed to survive and reemerged years later. Various factions also formed from the remnants of the former empire. Some separatists aimed to recreate the Covenant under Sangheili(Elites) leadership, free from San'Shyuum(Prophets) influence. One of the more notable factions, led by Jul 'Mdama, claimed to be a new "Covenant," maintaining several of the old empire’s religious tenets. Additionally, several hostile factions emerged, utilizing assets from the fallen empire, including Merg Vol's faction, Sali 'Nyon's faction, Vata 'Gajat's faction, and the Banished.</p>

                    <h2>historians note</h2>
                    <p>The Kig-Yar, also known as Jackals, were the first aliens encountered by humanity near Harvest. This initial contact set off a chain of events that would lead to full-scale military action between humanity and the Covenant. the Kig-Yar continued to patrol the space surrounding humanity's known territories. They were instrumental in discovering numerous human colonies, including Madrigal, and reported their findings to the rest of the Covenant fleet. Following the outbreak of the Human-Covenant War, human encounters with Kig-Yar were brief and poorly documented. Rumors and fragmentary evidence pointed to incidents of Jackal piracy against human civilians.

                    <p> UNSC designation: Covenant secundarium carnivora prœdonis, Latin for "Covenant secondary carnivorous combatant" The Office of Naval Intelligence has designated the following species as "Jackals", as it is a name preferred by troops. These dinosaur-like, saurian beings that exhibit a scavenger nature, resembling privateers. ONI commonly identifies two main groupings—(Jackals and Skirmishers).

                        In combat, they will typically serve as snipers and scouts due to their exceptional senses of sight, smell, and hearing. If encountered, it is best to retreat, but if possible preferable to fight if a firearm can be acquired, given their speed it is not likly you can get away without a vehicle. if they confront you in close quarters a blunt weapon is effective Jackals are somewhat physically frail with bones similar to birds
                        
                        Caution: Do not hide from Jackals, as their sense of smell is acute. If hiding is necessary, barricade all entrances and wait for UNSC forces while masking your scent they are opportunistic they will move on if pray is to difficult to get to.
                        
                         they appear to hold a low standing in the Covenant hierarchy, they operated as mercenaries, often siphoning resources for their own use while avoiding vocal complaints about their status.

                        Kig-Yar primarily served as light infantry, and marksmen. they have been said to give off a salty smell. the female veriaty apear to act as commanders in battle, leading to ONI beliving they are a matriarchal meaning females are leaders we have to assume they are more dangerous.
                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Biology</h3>
                        <p>Jackal share many features with Earth avians and reptiles, though ONI mistakenly classified them as K9 like until an atopsy was preformed. They exhibit characteristics common among species that evolved in low-gravity, such as Lacerta erectus. Their legs are sinewy and muscular, structured in a digitigrade manner. They possess very sharp teeth and a hooked, bird-like beak in some cases. Both their hands and feet are tridactyl, with sharp talons, and their hands have a unique structure with a large middle finger surrounded by two opposable thumbs.

                            Their eyes are protected by a membrane that sweeps horizontally across the eye much like a bird of prey. Starved Jackal Kig-Yar have been known to eat the flesh of fallen enemies. They possess extraordinarily acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Highly agile, they can execute swift jumps and rolls in combat, particularly the more muscular Skirmisher subspecies, (witch seems to have been obseved to have a higher rank in whatever class system the Covanant posseses.) can leap great distances and move at extremely high speeds. a Jackal, are known for their strong, salty, and occasionally acrid stench.
                            
                            Male Jackal possess plumes of spiny quills (feathers if Skirmishers) at the back of their heads and on their elbows; the color of this plumage reflects their mood. Quill colors vary between subspecies, with Jackal quills typically appearing brown, red, or light blue, while Skirmishers generally have black or reddish feathers. females lack these quills, having instead calloused plates on their forearms and at the back of their heads. This thick skin protects them during courtship, as males often bite and tear at the back of the female's head, neck, and arms. Aside from reproductive organs, there is no significant physical difference between male and female Jackals.
                            
                            While Jackal are somewhat physically frail, they can move quickly to evade harm. Their blood is bright purple, They lack high amounts of calcium in their skeletons.

                        <p>The Office of Naval Intelligence has designated the following Covenant species as "Grunts," named for the role they play in combat. Grunts are a sapient species of squat, bipedal xeno-arthropodal vertebrates. They possess exoskeletons similar to bugs or crabs; this shell-like material is brittle in some areas, soft near joints, and strong near the limbs, capable of cracking under sufficient pressure. While they can be dealt with easily when encountered alone using makeshift weapons, civilians are advised to run when faced with them in numbers, this is the best chance of survial as Grunts are generally less nimble than the average human. they apear to be like slaves or the lowest in an apparent cast system.

                            Grunts share traits with various Earth species: they walk bipedally with the aid of oversized forearms, have a hard exoskeleton, and possess small, pointed teeth similar to reptiles. They average four to five feet in height and are relatively weak. Their flat, three-toed feet allow them to walk upright, but they often rely on their arms for stability or speed, especially when unarmed. Their vision and hearing are average, but they have a keen sense of smell, aided by olfactory membranes in their masks. Grunts are adept climbers on rocky terrain, though clumsy when walking upright. Their rigid exoskeleton, lined with sharp barbs, provides protection against predators, and they have quick finger reflexes, enabling them to fire plasma pistols rapidly.Although they require an atmosphere to breathe, Unggoy are capable of surviving in the vacuum of space without sealed, full-body gear. However, they must employ sealed face masks in order to breathe, as well as presumably to protect their facial tissues. Grunts give off a pungent odder, if it reaks be on alert.</p>
                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Biology</h3>
                        <p>The taxonomic classification of the Unggoy has confused the United Nations Space Command, which misclassified them as arthropods due to their exoskeletons. However, they are actually xeno-arthropodal vertebrates with a closed circulatory system, potentially influenced by primate-like amphibians from planetary dark zones. This incorrect nomenclature persisted into 2557, though concerns were overshadowed by the Human-Covenant War. Unggoy are the only Covenant species to breathe methane rather than oxygen. Their combat armor/harness has an integrated methane re-breather system, as Unggoy are unable to survive for long periods of time without methane due to asphyxiation.they could be afflicted by barnacles; the removal of barnacles leads to deep, oozing pores in their chitinous skin.
                            Grunts also have thick, bioluminescent, light-blue blood, possibly a result of methane-based proteins in the blood to facilitate methane-based respiration. ike Earth's horseshoe crabs, it is possible that their blood is blue due to high copper content. They also possess yellowish-green colored viscera, To humans, Unggoy are known to have a distinct smell of vomit, or manure, associated with their presence.
